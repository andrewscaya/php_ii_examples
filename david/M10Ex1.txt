Without looking at the code, I would have to say the best way to ensure security is to use security best practices:
 
 1) Input should be validated on the server. 
 2) Output should be escaped.
 3) Use the principle of least privilege. Give users the bare minimum of 
    permissions to complete their tasks.
 4) Set php.ini to not display errors in a production environment.
 5) Initialize all variables.
 6) Check that variables are set (isset).
 7) Only pass identifiers of cookies, not the actual data. Set $httponly 
    parameter to "true" in setcookie().
 8) Use debugging techniques instead of echo or print to check if you get 
    the expected output from your code. Be sure to check the logs for error output.
